\maketitle

% \begin{abstract}
%   We study five different notions of finiteness in Cubical Type Theory and prove
%   the relationship between them.
%   In particular we show that any totally ordered Kuratowski finite type is
%   manifestly Bishop finite.

%   We also prove closure properties for each finite type, and classify them
%   topos-theoretically.
%   This includes a proof that the category of decidable Kuratowski finite sets
%   (also called the category of cardinal finite sets) form a \(\Pi\)-pretopos.

%   We then develop a parallel classification for the countably infinite types, as
%   well as a proof of the countability of \(A^\star\) for a countable type \(A\).

%   We formalise our work in Cubical Agda, where we implement a library for proof
%   search (including combinators for level-polymorphic fully generic currying).
%   Through this library we demonstrate a number of uses for the computational
%   content of the univalence axiom, including searching for and synthesising
%   functions.
