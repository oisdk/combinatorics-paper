\chapter{Countdown}
Countdown is a well-known functional programming puzzle (with a spin-off TV show
in the UK), first popularised as a puzzle in which to demonstrate functional
algorithms in \cite{huttonCountdownProblem2002}.
The idea is simple: given a list of numbers, contestants must construct an
arithmetic expression (using a small set of functions) using some or all of the
numbers, to reach some target.
